        .panel-body
          Pithugram is a service for friends, family, and coworkers to
          communicate and stay connected through the exchange of quick, frequent messages.
          People post Tweets, which may contain photos, videos, links and up to 140 characters of text.
          These messages are posted to your profile,
          sent to your followers, and are searchable on Pithugram search.

        .panel-heading Who reads my updates?
        .panel-body
          Your followers read your Tweets. If your Tweets are public, anyone who runs a search for a keyword in your Tweet may be able to see that message. Your Tweets are public by default; if you're hesitant to have people you may not know read your updates,
          protect your Tweets to approve followers and keep your updates out of search.
