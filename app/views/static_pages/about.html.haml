          First, you could search Pithugram to see if anyone is talking (tweeting) about cloud computing. A quick search reveals that lots of Pithugram members are talking about cloud computing.

        %p
          You could simply keep tabs on cloud computing by returning and searching Pithugram each day (not very efficient -- but effective) or you could join Pithugram and follow people who have posted tweets that catch your interest.
